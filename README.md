# dob (Docker Odoo Bootstrap)

YAML based Odoo deployment tool using Docker. Docker sets up the environment Odoo will
be built into, installs Debian, NPM, and Python packages. The further tooling is done by
[dob-lib](https://pypi.org/project/doblib). See the usage. For a documentation of the
main YAML structure see the [Further configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Compatibility

_dob_ only works with Python 3.6 or greater. Python 2.x is and will not be supported.

## Usage

Use `-f docker-compose.yaml -f mailhog.yaml` after `docker-compose` if a mailsink is
needed.

```
# To be able to use the git keys of the current user
$ ./setup.sh
# Build, initialization and start up
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo init
$ docker-compose run --rm odoo odoo update
$ docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

Minimal `.env` configuration file is generated by `setup.sh`. For production it's
recommended to set the value of `DB_VERSION` to a recent/supported one of postgresql.
Best is to use major versions with `-alpine` suffix.
[Further configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Available commands

See [Commands](docs/command.md).

## Environment variables of `.env`

See [Docker Environment](docs/environment.md).

## Deployments

There are multiple ways to deploy this project on servers. Beside the manual deployments
using the commands above you can also rely on a more autonomous one. See
[Deployment](docs/deploy.md) for more information.
